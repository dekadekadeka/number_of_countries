# Number of Countries
See how you compare to the US and world average number of countries visited.

## Instructions
1. Make sure you have [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) installed first.
  - On Mac, you can run `brew install gfortran` and that's it.
2. Navigate to the directory you pulled down the repo into.
  - If you opened the repo in your IDE, you should already be in the correct place.
3. Run `gfortran number_of_countries.f90 -o number_of_countries ` in the terminal to compile
4. Run ` ./number_of_countries` in the terminal to start the program.
  - Alternatively, after you compile, and outside of your text editor/IDE, double-click on the binary file that was generated in the same directory to run the program; a terminal window running the program will open.

## Why Fortran?
Why not? I always wanted to try it before, what better time than now? It really helps you appreciate how far things have come, while seeing how many of the basics stayed the same!

## What text editor/IDE can I use? Isn't this how they used to code with punch cards way back in the day?
This is indeed one of the languages they used to code with punch cards, it's the whole reason I wanted to try it! I used VSCode with the [Modern Fortran extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fortran-lang.linter-gfortran).
